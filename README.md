I was dreaming about:

- passionate employee = empregado afficionado

'Emficionado'

I didn't know the word afficionado before but it seems to be a word in portuguese, spanish, english. Crazy!

It's kind of a more to the point version of ikigai in one word. it focuses on the 2 things that matter: work for someone with your passion.

skill and what the world needs automatically follow.

It could be seen as a step before entrepreneurship

- first you need to have a passion
- then you get paid for work
- then you combine the two so you get paid for your passion

Emficionado is a nice name for a platform that indexes passions of humans to create an indexation of potential employees that actually like to work with you.

I'd love to put out my own philosophy of work:

- work on whatever peaks your interest and what you love most at any given time
- take as little obligations as possible while being exposed to as many payment opportunities as possible
- automatically share your work with people and companies that can benefit from it to build trust. with that, also send a request for payment (RFP) so the company has an opportunity to reward you for your work.

My problem is that I am not sharing my work as it's a lot of work to share, and not my core quality nor interest. What seems to be useful, is this type of network so this sharing can be done automatically.

A potential roadmap could look like this:

1. as all my work passes github, create an agent that tracks my activities there and sees what I'm working on, and is able to comprehend this.
2. scrape a network of people with shared passion. first extract historical passion from my github activities, then extrapolate on each micropassion by running continuous search agents for them to find people and companies with similar passions. for each contact, find a channel of communication too.
3. establish a connection and share interesting work with them in a spread-out way (max 1 mail per month) that highlights the most interesting work with any of them. invite them for conversations about it and rfp.
